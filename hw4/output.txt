" the consequences of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry , " panetta said in a letter to senators республиканцу республиканке and john mccain , arizona , lindsey graham , of south carolina .
" so , would make such a strong contraction , the majority of our construction projects on кораблестроению and unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of a ship or the building -- and will seriously damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote senators .

guides , which should be taught the opposite , sending a message that lies and fraud are acceptable .
during one day , as the research shows , you can lie from the 10 % to 200 times .
another study that strangers солгали nearly three times in the first 10 minutes of familiarity with each other .
in contrast to the game room , like , say , charades , where the need to exclaim " caught ! " , detecting lies is a serious of knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the past six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , particularly in psychology and physiology .
is not out of this hard to conclude that the liars notice and it 's hard to expose .
i spent a few years , by examining the scientific discoveries in the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lie detection , and it is clear that modern skills , which is easy to learn and that helps in meaningful in our complex world -- especially if your professional obligations include recruiting , interviewing , negotiating or management .
we know from studies that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts , and that the men lie about yourself , whereas women -- more about the other , usually in order to protect someone 's feelings , lied to its partners that married people less than unmarried ( but the lie that they say , most often наглая . )
observe per asphyxia , and laughter , voice features to your facility .
rats can fix the top of his body , when trying to recall their history , they can to put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , or change its position in a certain way to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complicated issues behind us .
привирающие people can also use the disengagement in the speech : " i have n't had sexual relationships with that woman miss lewinsky " or repeat a complicated question entirely . ...
someone can use the " qualification language " when answering a question : " well ... the truth ... as far as i know ... as far as i am aware . "
there is no magic money fraud detection to expose the lies , but to master the skill you can .

this morning on tuesday , the yields on italian 10 - year bond reached 6,85 % , and the yields on spanish bonds with the same maturity reached 6.2 % .
head of the future of the italian government of mario monti asked markets time to restore the situation in italy , under threat to the paralysis , under the weight of its debt .
spain has proved to be under the shelling in the markets before the parliamentary elections in on sunday .
insee , despite this , to reduce the numbers in the second quarter , with the fall of the 0.1 percent of gross domestic product ( gdp ) rather than stagnation .
germany , who in turn , documented the rise by 0.5 percent for the same period .
if there is a theme , the decision on which cannot be taken after a short discussion , or under the influence of emotion , so it 's energy policy .
it is a healthy trend , that the electoral meeting place , and become an occasion for reflection about the share of their nuclear power .
france must be to build their own opinion on the objective facts and the rational .
during the same period will be necessary to complete a growing scarcity of fossil resources to continue electricity production ever , not forgetting the critical need to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions , to fight climate imbalances - theme , which had disappeared from the environmental debate .
here 's why germany is one in your decision to refrain from nuclear energy .
on the other hand , the uk , finland , poland , czech republic , the netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil - this is only a few of those who strongly to their projects .
although the model of germany , which is based on the renewable energy , sometimes as an example of the reality belies this argument .
european champion construction of turbines , from which she receives a 30 % of its electricity , as well as the biggest consumer of coal and gas прерывистого wind ; because of the carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices 65 per cent , respectively , and 50 % higher than the average for europe .
as in a globalized economy , the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and the service of industrial equipment on the national territory , the french companies benefiting from cheap electricity to europe .
price , which the majority of the french refuse to pay more , because they do n't object to this kind of energy in general .
heavily export - oriented , she attracts a contemporaries focused on international trade in small and medium - sized enterprises and create many jobs , which may not be moved to another industry .
what an engineer - electrician will order epr , calculated , to work for sixty years , if the planned closure of its manufacturer ?
development of the areva solutions with the low - carbon , nuclear and renewable energy , testifies взаимодополнимости sources .
security in france , we have the authority , which is edged and transparent control existing energy , such as фламанвиль centers .
within 50 years ago atomic power industry has survived three major incident .
in the chernobyl reactor and the unforgivable device human error that has led to tragedy .
as the nuclear industry will the lessons from this an accident , learned from the previous two .
as he viewed all the specialists in the field of energy , to build a reactor , halt its construction in фламанвиле will be a great gift for menacing rivals areva and edf , ​​путь them toward the conquest of leadership in the imminent development of nuclear energy .
then was administrative harassment of foreign students , which was in the news release , when the minister of interior ( " либерасьон " from may 23 ) , said that france " does not need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . "
both sides see the burden for the french of the economy and immigration for the french of society .
francois hollande was confined to platitudes , in his program , saying that " the joint work will solve our immigration problem . "
as ian goldin and jeffrey cameron reminds us economists in a recent book , обобщившей past data about the immigration ( special : how migration shaped our world and people will determine our future , may 2011 , at princeton university , with 352 . ) , there is a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth , employment and wages in countries that accept immigrants .
fears for the influence of immigrants are based on the view that they are able to replace local workers , particularly the low - skilled , provoking lower wages .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor force , and the most qualified , in the dynamic sectors , where training is not connected with offers of work .
just as the surgeon would be difficult to work in the country , where there is a lack of анестезиологов complementarity between local and immigrants , leads to the arrival of immigrants that positively affects the salaries of local workers .
and this is without taking into account the fact that diversity , вносимое immigrants , contributes to new ideas and economic growth ( among the american nobel laureates large share of naturalized immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo - were all based on immigrants ) .
according to the labor organization , for example , in a german immigrant , arrived at the age of 30 years , for his own life will bring the state budget net profit ( revenue minus expenses ) in the average of 150,000 euros .
these teeth that are used to scare immigrants did precisely the opposite effect .
democracy - is fragile and precious acquisition ; but also at the same time .
some believed that democracy had finally triumphed over their enemies , is enough to arrange a vote and make it so direct , as far as possible .
universal vote , though , and is a prerequisite for democracy , it is not sufficient condition and may even become a " tool of suppression " , as republican said when a philosopher etienne вашро .
the european crisis , we are experiencing , " it 's an economic crisis , but in the first is a political crisis and the crisis of democracy .
we do n't win anything , requiring a series of national referendums , organized as necessary and in хаотическом manner .
no , we are dreaming not of the edge the guillotine , but the implementation of the joint , clear and constant - choice and democracy , at this time on the european level .
all europe entirely to the dictates of markets and rating agencies suffer from its weakness and lack of solidarity .
many worry about the transfer of sovereignty in europe , but the entire europe gradually losing its sovereignty , and each of the nations along with it .
because only the joint work of europeans will reduce the severity of the debt each , free markets and prepare for the future , investing in him .
after a lengthy discussion of this offer and jacques delors all socialists now require that the european economic government .
but to submit its own without a stronger economic , political and democratic integration , maturing in граздан , is another madness and a stalemate .
to set the republic of the france , was to " create " a republican .
this can only be done through the creation of a more democratic europe on a political level , of popular european sovereignty .
in fact , 2011 will be completed 11 % increase in global sales of microprocessors , bank cards , mobile phones with sim cards ) , above , according to eurosmart 6 thousand million units .
this year , in the world will be sold to 460 million бесконтактных chip cards against a 320 million a year earlier .
europe has long lagged from the asia - pacific region , is now moving forward into the field of бесконтактных payments .
france starts with more moderate positions : the treatment are 400,000 бесконтактных visa debit cards .
in this year , carrefour has 2.5 million a бесконтактных pass mastercard .
two large organisations in france promised in the future " systematically to distribute among their customers ' bank cards , suited for non - use , " said gerard небуи , director - general of the visa europe , france .
but this is only the first stage of the development of future cash payment , then there is a mobile phone .
" we look forward to the world 's sales from 80 to 120 million units in 2012 , " explains mark бертен , eurosmart head .
yesterday , the crédit agricole announced the experiment , since december by june next year in a massacre .
confirmed long предполагавшиеся ties between the terrorist group al-qaida in islamic maghreb ( aqmi ) , and the nigerian sect boko haram .
" way , which use these two institutions , and reports of secret service show that they are actively cooperate , " he explained , without going into the details .
among the wreckage , the remaining after the operation , french and нигерские investigators have found a few telephone sim cards that belonged to terrorists .
analysis of the calls pointed at several interlocutors , were in mali , niger , nigeria .
" this is a step forward , but there is no doubt that we need to wait for more reliable evidence , before the talk about operational cooperation between aqmi and boko haram . "
" for many years , we know that the sect идейную and receives financial support from the outside and that it is becoming more and more aggressive , " says кунле амуво nigerian researcher .
the international community , headed by washington now puts pressure on абуджу , to pay attention to the problem , which creates the boko haram .
she aims mainly in on the of the church , and bars and the authorities .
in the past christmas , she took on responsibility for the diluted share , as a result of which 80 people were killed in джосе , and then another for one in abuja .
in august to a local branch of the united nations , will be of their first international goal .
today , when the aqmi has spiked in mali and niger , and the somalis of al-shabaab in kenya , the boko haram is a threat to the continent .
weakened by crisis , america can lead a complicated world by using the simple , and rather simplistic ideas ?
kane has a few days , mitt romney , the distance , rick perry and other множат loud , but deprived of the details of the statements on foreign policy , which are traditionally a strong republican party .
mitt romney , who has the best chance for the nomination from the good old party , has threatened to sue chinese wto complaint " and accuse them of " manipulating its currency is a sensitive topic for america , irritated migration for their industries in asia .
jon huntsman , former obama ambassador to china and the only one candidate , the complex foreign policy , could n't overcome position , that appeasing emotions .
but the huntsman , who has been in the bottom part of the ratings , left неуслышанным .
romney also pledged to the military strikes against iran if sanctions would not be able to stop its nuclear program .
if obama " will be re - elected , and they will have the bomb " .
entrepreneur херман kane , the second in the rankings , showed the daunting ignorance of the business .
the texas governor rick perry , who supports israel , and seeks to military strikes on iran , " says , that is ready to use the us army against drug cartels in mexico .
this is all very far away from the 2008 republican presidential candidate john mccain , тяжеловеса foreign policies .
they remind us that obama was himself a lover and that he had to lower the tone in relation to the fight against terrorism .
after iraq did not believe it is in a military intervention , which confused the sand .
nord stream , the new gates for the entrance of russian gas supplies to europe .
he is designed on the supply of natural gas equivalent of the 30 - million households .
more than 500 guests , including four heads of state and participated in the last tuesday on the banks of the baltic sea , between the performance of the orchestra and the exquisite snacks , in the opening of the nord stream , a new pipeline , which directly links russia and germany under the water .
on a new pipeline 27.5 million of additional cubic metres of gas will come every year in the western europe for the first 1 224 km long pipeline connecting the leningrad region , with the land of mecklenburg - pomerania .
and an opportunity to build a third of the pipeline at the same direction has already been discussed .
those two countries will lose part of its power : they become more difficult to influence russia threatening to shut down access to the western european markets .
but the cost of europe 's energy , because that the project has created a gap between eastern and western europe .
" this pipeline is part of cooperation with russia , it 's a new artery that connects us organically , " said francois fillon , opening the pipeline , showing the extent to which the big , gas contracts are important and politically and economically .
" a hundred need was to remove or destroy as a precaution , " said jens muller , a spokeswoman for the company nord stream .
pipeline is a long metal serpent weight , equal to weight of the 242 эйфелевых towers , without breaks throughout its length , and without the service stations .
" we close the flood of gas in the case of the accident in less than a minute , " says jens mueller .
but it seems unlikely that piping designers , stitches , designed for протечку only once in 100,000 years old .
сигароообразный machine inside the pipeline is a 1 - meter diameter and pushed forward flow of natural gas .
pipeline was designed to work in over 50 years , without the necessity to any repairs .
these five companies have created a joint venture , called the northern flow , was commissioned to build and operate the pipeline .
then gazprom gave the company in rent on the twenty - five years with the possibility of extension of the entire volume of gas .
funding for the natural gas pipeline was provided on the 30 % of the shareholders and the 70 % of bank loans .
gas out from baltic sea in lubmin on the sandy shore , mulberry coniferous trees " .
sensors measure pressure , temperature and the specific characteristics of gas before they siphoned it in a german gas pipelines .
at full capacity , it will be 3 million an hour , and , in 2012 , $ 6 million .
